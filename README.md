# CerealCom
CerealCom is a Chrome App for serial communication over RS-232. It has many features that other serial apps for Chrome don't like easily selecting your port, baud rate, and several other features.
CerealCom also allows you to do data recording and sending files over serial ports. It's very versatile, though not perfect.
CerealCom was one of my first projects as a programmer in my free time. It is easy to see several bad code practices and some that is just plain dumb. That being said, this project is no longer being supported. If anyone would like to take a crack at making it better, go for it.
I apologize for the horrendousness of the code, but I also admit I probably won't be fixing it. I have had several requests for the code, so here it is in all its glory. Enjoy!
